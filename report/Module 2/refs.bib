abstract = {A method to calculate the elastic scattering amplitude at low energies in two-dimensional quantum field theories is proposed and tested in a numerical simulation of the O(3) non-linear σ-model on a simple square lattice. We also compute the isospin current form factor in this model and compare our results with the known exact expressions for the S-matrix and the form factor in the continuum limit. As a technical improvement, we introduce a two-cluster simulation algorithm which leads to significantly reduced statistical errors in the calculation of four-point correlation functions.}
